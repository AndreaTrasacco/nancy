# Nancy
## _A computational library for Deterministic Network Calculus_

[![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Unipi.Nancy)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unipi.Nancy/)

Nancy is a C# library implementing min-plus and max-plus operators for ultimately pseudo-periodic piecewise affine curves.

See the [webpage](https://rzippo.github.io/nancy/) for tutorials and the full documentation.
See the [tutorial notebooks](./examples/) to play directly with code.

Prebuilt package on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unipi.Nancy/).

## Language and requirements

Nancy is a .NET 6.0 library, written in C# 10.
Both SDK and runtime for .NET are cross-platform, and can be downloaded from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).
